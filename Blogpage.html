            <h2>Start</h2>
            <p>
                The start of the Assignment was a smooth experience as i already contained some valuable coding i could
                reuse which where stored inside my work folder (will be referenced within the report log) so all i had
                 to do was adjust certain aspects including background colours and Navigation tags. However i did
                 run into a major issue where my buttons would not post up when i opened up the web page so i had to mend it up
                 before going forward (more information about this process can be found within the reportlog page.)

            </p>

            <h2>Middle</h2>
            <p>
                The middle stages was not a very plesent transition as i was met with a lot of errors forcing me to
                make a lot of tweaks and adjustements to the pages/stylesheets in which resulted to a lot
                of commits made which can be found in my repository on github.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>End</h2>
            <p>
                Near the end of the project everything came together
            </p>
