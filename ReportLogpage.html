        <h1>Starting Phases</h1>
        <p>
        Learning the ropes of web development has been a very shaky experience for me, this
        is mainly due to me not having much experience when it comes to coding languages as a whole
        but i gave it my best either way and the result came out fairly decent. The main area i had
        troubles with were the hyperlinks as i had a lot of trouble syncing them with my github,
        to fix this i learnt how to successfully merge pages into the master branch
     </p>

    <p>
        This image shows how i've managed to create the hyperlinks to the other webpages
        and what kind of codes i used. The codes used here were from a recycled work project
        i had did before i started this assignment in which i reused and changed certain
        aspects in order for it to fit my websites theme. The image below shows the end result 
        of the coding, and this kind of layout is consistent throughout all of the pages
    </p>

        On the right side is the process of merging files into the master branch,
        i had a lot of troubles in finding a way to do this using the desktop version of github
        but i eventually looked up how to do this and the process was fairly straight forwards.
        If i had to pick a section that cost me the most time it was linking up my website
        to github
    </p>

    <h1>Design Phase</h1>
    <p>
        The design stage was the most interesting stage as i had the tools to completely
        design the website the way i want it to look and since i actually had some experience
        writing up CSS this process was a less daunting task. My main focus at this point was
        to ensure consistency between the desktop and mobile versions, in order to achieve this 
        i had to create seperate stylesheets for each versions and customize them
    </p>
