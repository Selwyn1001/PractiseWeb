        <p>
        Learning the ropes of web development has been a very shaky experience for me, this
        is mainly due to me not having much experience when it comes to coding languages as a whole
        but i gave it my best either way and the result came out fairly decent. The main area i had
        troubles with were the hyperlinks as i had a lot of trouble syncing them with my github,
        to fix this i learnt how to successfully merge pages into the master branch
     </p>

        This image shows how i've managed to create the hyperlinks to the other webpages
        and what kind of codes i used. The codes used here were from a recycled work project
        i had did before i started this assignment in which i reused and changed certain
        aspects in order for it to fit my websites theme.
